# State

A stateful component is independent of its content and has the ability to update itself based on internal triggers.

In general, any state used in a web application belongs to one of three categories: 1. Application data, 2. UI state, 3. Form data.

Call `useState` in the functional component and supply an initial value. Destructure the response from calling `useState` as two array elements o The first element is the current value `o` The second element is a setter function.

```ts
const [o, setter] = useState(initialValue)
```

When you want to update the state, simply call the setter with either a function or a plain value.

```ts
setter((originValue) -> updateoValue)
```

**As `useState` is a kind of hook, if you use it in a component, the `useState` must be invoked every time the component render. And if multiple `useState`, they must be invoked in the same order every time.**

The state of component can be shared with other component via, e.g. property.
